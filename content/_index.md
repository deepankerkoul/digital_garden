This is my Digital garden, where I plant and scatter different seeds or ideas. These could be about something I have learnt recently or something more serious, which I'm researching.

Some of the things that I'm thinking about currently are:
1. [[notes/public_finance/Public Finance|Public Finance]] 🪙
2. Engineering Prosperity 💹
3. Digital Resources and Value Extraction 💻
4. Unclassified Thoughts 🔁
