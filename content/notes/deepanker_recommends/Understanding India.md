## Works of Fictions

- Partition of India
	- Train to Pakistan
		- By Khushwant Singh
- [[notes/deepanker_recommends/Kashmir|Kashmir]]
- Bengal
	- Anandamath
		- By Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay
		- Language: Hindi
		- Deals with the Sansyasin revolution. Some people might find themes and language that might sound Islamophobic for someone bringing 21st century lens, but for me it's set in time when Indian identity was evolving and rising against foreign invaders and colonists, and at that time it included muslim rulers as well along with britishers. 
		- In fact, Britishers are at times seen as liberators against the tyrant muslim rulers.
- Indians outside India
	- The Namesake
	- A House for Mr. Biswas
