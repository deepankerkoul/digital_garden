- ### Fiction
	- **Shalimar the Clown**
		- Novel by Salman Rushdie, Magical Realism
		- The span of the story is from 1940s to 2005 and while I have some reservations with how some people and communities are portrayed, I think this has to be one of the best works of fiction on a global scale.


## Movies and Documentaries
1. **Kashmir Files** 
	- Film by Vivek Agnihotri
	- I have my reservations with the narrative liberties taken by Vivek Agnihotri in this film, but at the same time, this is the only mainstream movie that tackles the subject of 1990s exodus head on and does not dance around it.
	- *Note: 
		- *Shikara which was loosely based on Our Moon has Blood Clots was also a mainstream bollywood movie dealing with exodus but the was turned into a romantic movie which felt tone deaf to me and many more.*
		- *I had predicted S*
2. **Notebook from Kashmir** 
	- Documentary on Youtube by Naveen Pandita 
	- About Nandimarg Massacre, which took place around 2003 where around 24 Kashmiri pandits were killed. The victims ranged from a 65-year-old man to a 2-year-old boy.
	- Kashmir Files' closing scene is (in my view) inspired from this incident.
