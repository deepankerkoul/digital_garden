## Fiction (Books and Movies)
Most of these are originally books that have been adapted into movies as well. I'd suggest the books to stay true to the message but if movies are your thing, feel free to watch instead of reading
- Dystopia
	- 1984 - 
	- A Clockwork Orange
- Animal Farm
- Crime and Punishment
- Metamorphosis
- **Gender Violence**
	- When I Hit You: Or, A Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife

## Non- Fiction
- Man's Search for Meaning
- Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead


## Self-Helpy books
Self-helps have a well-deserved bad reputation but once in a while you get books that rise above the muck and are genuine learning experiences.
- Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead
