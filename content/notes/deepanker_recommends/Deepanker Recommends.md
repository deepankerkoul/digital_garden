This is where I share books, movies, papers and courses that taught me what I know. I've shared it by topics but feel free to use the search function to jump around and find what you's like.

I'm also expecting the list here to get updated from time to time, if I find something fits somewhere else better. In case, you can't find something that you could earlier, search function is your best friend. 🐶

Finally, this is work of love. I don't use AI or some pre-curated list to generate these. So if you benefit from this, please let me know. Motivation is a really scarce resouce.

PS:
There can be rare inaccuracies since I'm curating this from memory, but if it does occur, please reach out to me and I'll mend it or else clarify if it is a subjective interpretation.
